## Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|SQL                   |NoSQL                    |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
|primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)| primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
|table based databases|document based, key-value pairs, graph databases|
| vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
|have predefined schema|have dynamic schema for unstructured data|

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example.
**for the complex query intensive environment ex:MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL** 
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example. 
**fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data ex:MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb**
4. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**NoSQL database**
5. Which type of database is best for scalability?
**NoSQL databases**

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?**structured query language**
2. What is a realational database?**a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.**
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?**the data tables, views, and indexes**

4. What is a ‘schema’?**refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed**
5. What is a NoSQL database?**non-relational database.**
6. Howo does it work?**NoSQL databases use a variety of data models for accessing and managing data. These types of databases are optimized specifically for applications that require large data volume, low latency, and flexible data models, which are achieved by relaxing some of the data consistency restrictions of other databases.**
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documen**
8. is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
**MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability**

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* .NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).
* .NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.
* .NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases, which means that are far less stable and may have a lot less functionalities.
