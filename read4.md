# OOP:Object-oriented programming

## Objectes

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.

Objects provides a number of benefits, including:

1. Modularity
2. Information-hiding
3. re-use
4. Pluggability and debugging ease

## Classes

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
we use the keyword class to declare a class. Inside the class, we define class objects and methods.

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### 1.Binary Numbers

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". it contain just 0 and 1.

### 2.Decimals

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

### 3.Hexadecimal Numbers

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
