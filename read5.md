# Linked Lists

## data structures

Its the different ways that we can organize our data.variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures.

### Types of data structures

![data structures](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191010170332/Untitled-Diagram-183.png)

### Linear Data Structure

the data elements in this type  are arranged sequentially or in linear way.

### Non-linear Data Structure

the data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly

## Memory management

Arrays and linked lists are different in  the way in using memory of the device.

The main difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.

## What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

There are two types of Linked List :

1. Singly linked lists:are the simplest type of linked list.
2. doubly linked lists: it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value.It has a node that acts as the tail of the list

Parts of a linked list
The first part is the head then nodes and the last is null.

## what even is Big O?

Its a method of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.

There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs how much time and memory it needs.

* An O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements or huge our input is.

* An O(n) function is linear.

* O(n²) function, which clearly takes exponentially more time and memory the more elements.
