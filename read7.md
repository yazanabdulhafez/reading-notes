# Inheritance day 1

In this day we take a lot of information about the inheritance,access modifiers and abstract classes and methods.
I wonder if a class in one package could extends onther class in onther package?and how this done?
This is my qustion.

and my answer to the previous question wich was:how the child can inherit from the parent?
first we need to define the child class and the parent class.

* Child Class:
It is the class that extends the features of another class and its known as child class, sub class or derived class.

* Parent Class:
It is the class whose properties and functionalities are used(inherited) by another class and its known as parent class, super class or Base class.

The child class can inherit from the parent class all of its proprites and methods using the keyword extends like this:

```java
class child extends parent{

}
```

And we can add variables and methods belong to this child in addtion to the  properties and functionalities that inheritend from the parent.
