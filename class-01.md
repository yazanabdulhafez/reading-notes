# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
***Html uses eLements to describe the structure of Pages
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.***

***Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

---------
* Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using.


* If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
**<!-- comment goes here -->**


* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The **<div>** and **<span>** elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* **<iframes>** cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The **<meta>** tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as** <, >, and Â©**

* he new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple ***<div>*** elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,which is available free from Google.

* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
