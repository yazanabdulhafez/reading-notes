#  An introduction to wireframing
What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

As we mentioned above, different UX designers approach the task of wireframing in different ways. Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online. But more often than not, the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer

# How to make your wireframe in six steps:

1. Do your research.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference.
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5. Add some detail and get testing.
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.

### HTML basics

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way

The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

#### Headings
Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings 
example:<h1>My main title</h1>

#### Paragraphs
As explained above, <p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>

#### Lists
A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

1. Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.
2. Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.
Each item inside the lists is put inside an <li> (list item) element.

#### Links
Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". 
example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>.

#### Images
Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again:
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

## Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code 

-Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent.

-Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits.
 
-Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

##### **Semantic elements**
These are some semantic elements available:

-<article>

-<aside>

-<details>

-<figcaption>

-<figure>

-<footer>

-<header>

-<main>

-<mark>

-<nav>

-<section>

-<summary>

-<time>
