# Object-Oriented Design

## Don't repeat yourself(DRY)

Its an important principle aimed to reduce the repetition of the same code to avoid redundancy and put this code in blocks and make it reusable.

### Alternatives

#### WET

Stand for "write everything twice",WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with.

#### AHA

AHA stands for "Avoid Hasty Abstractions",it means that we use abstraction when its needed.

## Rule of three (computer programming)

* It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

* Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming.

* The rule implies that the cost of maintenance certainly outweighs the cost of refactoring.

## You aren't gonna need it

"You aren't gonna need it" Or (YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) ,it states that a programmer should not add functionality until it be needed.

## Minimum viable product

A minimum viable product (MVP) it is an expermental version of certain product ,to collect the feedback of the users to enhance this product.

### Purposes

1. Test the product.
2. Accelerate learning.
3. Reduce wasted engineering hours.
4. Get the product to early customers.
5. Base for other products
6. To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
7. Brand building faster.

### Criticism

Many developers of mobile and digital products are now criticizing the MVP because customers can go between products through platforms (e.g. app stores).
