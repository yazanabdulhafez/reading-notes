# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
**He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.**
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
**Because they weren't designed to be used like that. most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.**
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
**That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.**
4. What does a GET do?
**The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.**
5. What does a POST do?
**The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.**
6. What does PUT do?
**The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.**
7. What does PATCH do?
**The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.**
