# [Design web pages with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

## CSS syntax

CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

*h1 {*

    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
*}*

The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings *(<h1>)*.

We then have a set of curly braces *{ }*. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.

Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.

A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.

## Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS

### External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the *<link>* element, inside the head section.
**example**

**<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">**


### Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the *<style>* element, inside the head section.

**example**
<head>
<style>

body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}

</style>

*</head>*

### Inline CSS

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
**example:**

*<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>*

*<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>*


## Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

Inline style (inside an HTML element)
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

## CSS color Property
Definition and Usage

The color property specifies the color of text.

**CSS Syntax**

**color: color|initial|inherit;**


## Basic selectors
Basic selectors are fundamental selectors; these are the most basic selectors that are frequently combined to create other, more complex selectors.

Universal selector *, ns|*, *|*, |*
Type selector elementname
Class selector .classname
ID selector #idname
Attribute selector **[attr=value]**

## CSS Tools: Reset CSS

The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
