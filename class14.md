# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
**These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.**
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
**that most of  males  were way ahead of females because they'd grown up playing with computers.**

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
**when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.**
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
**research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.**
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
**hen YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.**
