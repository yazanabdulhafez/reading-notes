# [Programming with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in      parentheses and separated by commas.

 The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
 
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

function square(number) {

  return number * number;

}

## Calling functions

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

## Function scope
Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

## JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

## Function Return
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

### Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

**Example**

***Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:***

function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius(77);
The () Operator Invokes the Function
Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

Example
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius;

### Local Variables
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
